# Colores ✨ — Armada OS ready

RGB lighting control for handheld PCs, as a [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) plugin.

[Español](README.md) · English

## Armada OS compatibility

Colores is now ready to run natively on Armada OS:

- **Reliable audio-reactive lighting.** It uses the host's native tools, automatically follows audio output changes, and reconnects capture without restarting the plugin.
- **Ambilight on ARM64 and FEX environments.** It detects a complete PipeWire/GStreamer backend and, when needed, uses the bundled ARM64 fallback verified with checksums.
- **Native RGB for the Armada family.** It uses Armada OS hardware profiles for per-zone control on AYN Odin 2, Odin 3, Portal, and Thor; Retroid Pocket; KONKR Pocket FIT Elite; and MANGMI, preserving color correction, brightness, and Ambilight for each known topology.
- **Armada OS plasmoid for Plasma 6.** The source includes an installable widget
  combining the RGB light switch with the Eco, Balanced, and Performance
  profiles. It follows Plasma's configured language and is distributed as
  `Armada-OS.plasmoid`; see its [documentation and installation guide](armada/README.en.md).
- **Armada hardware emulator.** The ARM64 tool under
  [`emulator/`](emulator/README.en.md) loads a real Colores ZIP, runs its UI and
  backend, and renders the LEDs on a virtual handheld. Built-in patterns, video,
  and audio exercise Ambilight and audio-reactive mode without physical hardware.

Colores detects your handheld at startup and shows you only what your machine can actually do. No config, no editing files, no picking your model from a list. Open it from the quick access menu and you're set.

## Video

In this video I show and explain the plugin in depth:

[![Colores in action](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ug5Nh0YtadE/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ug5Nh0YtadE)

## Supported devices

| Brand | Models | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ASUS ROG | Ally, Ally X, Xbox Ally, Xbox Ally X | 4 RGB zones around the joystick rings |
| Lenovo Legion | Go, Go 2, Go S | Per-controller color, reconnect button (see below) |
| MSI | Claw, Claw 8 AI+ | 9 zones |

Not on the list? Colores still tries to use your device by reading whatever LEDs the system exposes. Those features show up marked as experimental: you can try them, but they may not behave well until I get that machine in hand to calibrate it. If there are no controllable LEDs at all, the plugin tells you instead of hanging.

## What you can do

- **Solid color.** Pick a hue and saturation. The simplest option, and what most people want.
- **Brightness.** On devices that support it.
- **Gradients.** An editor with presets (Sunset, Ocean, Aurora, Lava, Galaxy and more), per-zone color tuning, an auto palette, and a "Surprise me" button for when you can't decide. You can save your favorite gradients and reuse them.
- **Effects.** Breathing, rainbow, wave, cycle and spiral. Color effects use your solid color, and several can run over your custom gradient if you turn that on.
- **Ambient (Ambilight).** The lights follow what's on screen, taking color from the region near each joystick. It has vividness, smoothing and capture-rate controls.
- **Spanish, English, Italian, German, and Brazilian Portuguese.** Switch language from a compact selector in Settings. The plugin starts in Spanish.

Everything adapts to your handheld. If your machine only has a single global color, I won't show you a zone editor that wouldn't do anything.

## Things to keep in mind

- **Ambient only works in Game Mode with a game running.** It needs to read the image Game Mode composites. In Desktop or Big Picture there's nothing to capture, and the plugin warns you on screen instead of failing silently.

- **Legion Go: controllers disconnect after sleep.** When the handheld sleeps and wakes, the controllers sometimes lose the channel they receive colors on. That's why there's a **Reconnect controllers** button: if the lights stop responding after sleep, press it and they come back. It's not a plugin bug, it's how those controllers behave.

- **Legion Go: one color per controller.** The firmware on these machines doesn't allow multiple colors at once on a single controller, so a gradient shows as a smooth crossfade between colors rather than separate zones. The spiral is also the controller's own firmware rotating effect ("Spiral GO").

- **Unlisted devices.** Experimental features are exactly that, experimental. If you have a machine that isn't above and want to help add support, open an issue and I will take a look 🙌.

## Installation

The Decky plugin store is the easiest route when available. To install manually:

1. Download `Colores.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Hooandee/decky-colores/releases/latest).
2. In Decky, enable developer mode and install the zip from the install-from-file option.

Colores needs root to write to the system LEDs. Decky will prompt you for it at install.

## Get more out of your handheld

I make videos about handheld PCs, tips, tweaks and how to squeeze the most out of these machines. If you like Colores, swing by the channel: [youtube.com/@Hooandee](https://www.youtube.com/@Hooandee).

## Acknowledgements

The per-device lighting engine is adapted from [HueSync](https://github.com/honjow/HueSync) by honjow, released under the BSD 3-Clause license. Their work on the per-brand drivers is what lets Colores talk to so many different handhelds, and I keep their copyright notice as the license requires. Truly, thank you for sharing it.

Colores also builds on the [Decky plugin template](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-plugin-template) by Steam Deck Homebrew.

Made with a lot of love for handhelds ❤️.

## Development

In addition to the Decky plugin, this repository contains the Armada OS
plasmoid under [`armada/`](armada/README.en.md) and the emulator under
[`emulator/`](emulator/README.en.md). To build the deliverables:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build   # builds dist/index.js
python -m pytest             # backend tests
pnpm package:plasmoid        # builds Armada-OS.plasmoid
npm run package:emulator     # builds the ARM64 emulator AppImage
```

version must also release its source under the GPL — nobody can make it
closed-source. Portions adapted from HueSync keep their BSD 3-Clause notice
